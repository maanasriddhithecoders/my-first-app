The hope of the Death Cafe movement is to simply normalize this phase of life by allowing groups of people to conversate regarding death. Death Cafe is not a support group or a means of selling services, but is instead a simple social gathering, which can help you feel comfortable of this inevitable happening. There have been Death Cafes all over Colorado and the US."  @    https://deathcafe.com/site_media/img/teacup.jpg   @  REQUEST A TAXI.......
